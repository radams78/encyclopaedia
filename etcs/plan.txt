Proposition: f : A -> B is injective iff, for every set X and functions x,y : X -> A, if fx = fy then x = y.

Proposition:
1. Every section is injective.
2. If f : A -> B is injective and A is nonempty then f is a section.

Proposition: For any f : A -> B, the following are equivalent:
1. f is surjective.
2. For every set X and functions x,y : B -> X, if xf = yf then x = y.
3. f is a retraction.

Proposition: f is an isomorphism iff f is injective and surjective.

Define pullback

Pullback Lemma

Proposition: Let f : A -> B and j : V >-> B. Then there exists an inverse image of j under f.

Proof:
<1>1 Let chi : B -> 2 be the characteristic function of j.
<1>2 Let i : U >-> A be the inverse image of T under chi o f.
<1>3 Let g : U -> V be the unique function such that j o g = f o i.
<1>4 i : U >-> A is the inverse image of j under f.

Proposition: Any two functions f,g : A -> B have an equalizer.

Proof:
<1>1 Let f,g : A -> B.
<1>2 Let delta_B = < idB, idB > : B -> B x B
<1>3 delta_B is injective.
<1>4 Let i : U >-> A be the inverse image of <f,g> under delta_B.
<1>5 i is the equalizer of f and g.

Define subset, equality of subsets, inclusion.

Proposition: Subsets are equal if and only if they have the same characteristic function.

Definition: Given two subset i : U >-> X, j : V >-> X of X, the *intersection* is the inverse image of j under i, which is the same as the inverse image of i under j.

Proposition: There are at least two distinct subsets of 1.

Proof: The unique functions 0->1 and 1->1 are both injective, and not equal subsets, otherwise we would have 0 ~= 1 and so 0 would have an element.

Proposition: There are exactly two distinct subsets of 1.

Proof:
<1>1 Let U be a subset of 1 such that U =/= 0.
<1>4 Pick x in U such that chi_1(x) =/= chi_0(x)
<1>5 (1,id 1) = U as subsets of 1.

Corollary: Omega = 1 + 1

Definition: False is the other element of Omega.

Proposition: The characteristic function of U intersection V is and o < chi_U, chi_V >.

--- Universal Quantification

For any set A, we have T o ! : A -> 1 -> 2. Let t_A : 1 -> 2^A be the name of T o !.   (For all a in A, t_A(*)(a) = T.)

Let forall_A : 2^A -> 2 be the characteristic function of t_A.  (Given P in 2^A, we have forall_A(P) = T iff P(a) = T for all a in A, iff P = t_A.)

-- Power Set

Let PX = 2^X

Define phi_2 : X -> 2^(2^X) be the lambda of epsilon : X x 2^X -> 2. (So phi_2(x)(S) = T iff S(x) = T.)

Let psi_1 = pi_1 : 2^(2^X) x X -> 2^(2^X)

Let psi_2 = phi_2 o pi_2 : 2^(2^X) x X -> 2^(2^X)

Form the composite 2^(2^X) x X -<psi_1, psi_2>-> 2^(2^X) x 2^(2^X) ~= (2 x 2)^(2^X) -(imp^(2^X))-> 2^(2^X) -(forall)-> 2

Define Intersection to be its lambda Intersection : 2^(2^X) -> 2^X

-- The Empty Set

Proposition: 0 has no proper subsets.

Proof: A proper subset of 0 would be a proper subset of 1 different from 0.

Theorem: For any set X, there exists exactly one mapping 0 -> X.

Proof:
<1>1 Let X be a set.
<1>2 For any functions f,g : 0 -> X, we have f = g.
  <2>1 Let f,g : 0 -> X
  <2>2 Let e : E -> 0 be the equalizer of f and g.
  <2>3 e is an isomorphism.
    Proof: Otherwise (E,e) would be a proper subset of 0.
  <2>4 f = g
<1>3 There exists a function 0 -> X.
  <2>1 Let t : 1 -> 2^X be the name of the characteristic function of id X : X >-> X
  <2>2 Let delta : X -> X x X be delta = < id X, id X >
  <2>3 Let chi_delta : X x X -> 2 be the characteristic function of delta.
  <2>4 Let sigma = lambda chi_delta : X -> 2^X
  <2>5 sigma is mono
  <2>5 Let p : P -> 0 and q : P -> X be the pullback of t o ! : 0 -> 2^X and sigma : X -> 2^X
  <2>6 p is mono
  <2>7 p is an isomorphism
  <2>8 q o p-1 : 0 -> X
QED

Cor: For any set X we have 0 x X ~= 0.

Proof: There is exactly one map 0 -> 0^X, hence exactly one map 0 x X -> 0.

Cor: For any set X, if there exists a function X -> 0, then X ~= 0.

Proof: We have pi2 o <f, id x> = id X and <f , id X> o pi2 = id (0 x X) by the previous Corollary. Hence <f, id X> : X ~= 0 x X.

Theorem: If X is not isomorphic to 0 then X has an element.

Proof: By the arguments above, if X has no elements then X is initial so X ~= 0.
